# package_interface

Simple package interface for Linux Debian / Ubuntu systems.
The app uses a mock file although the file read path can be replaced with the path to the status file.

This application contains minimalistic styling and focuses mainly on the functionality.

Development instructions:

Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Run command:

```console
node server.js
```
to start the server.

The app can be viewed with a browser in localhost:3000
